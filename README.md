# It's Christmas again !

This repo is my secret tool for generating Secret Santa permutations!

## Instructions
For privacy reasons, I did not include my own family graph in the repo, but simply provided an example in data/example.json and data/example.gml.
Simply run src/secret-santa/main.py on a similar file will run the program!
